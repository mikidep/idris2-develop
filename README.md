# Idris2 + VSCodium developer environment

A quick and dirty developer environment to hack with Idris2.

## Prerequisites

Nix installed with flakes enabled. You can follow [this guide](https://github.com/mschwaig/howto-install-nix-with-flake-support), noting that step 2 is specific for system-wide installation, which is recommended anyway.

## How to use

In the cloned directory,

```sh
nix run -- .
```

Then work in the current directory.
